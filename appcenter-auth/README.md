# Visual Studio App Center SDK for React Native
## App Center Auth Module

App Center is your continuous integration, delivery and learning solution for iOS and Android apps. Get faster release cycles, higher-quality apps, and the insights to build what users want.

App Center Auth is a cloud-based identity management service that enables developers to authenticate application users and manage user identities. The service integrates with other parts of App Center, enabling developers to leverage the user identity to view user data in other services and even send push notifications to users instead of individual devices.
